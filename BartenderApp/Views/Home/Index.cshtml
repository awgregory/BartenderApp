    @*Inspect ActionLink in Chrome dev tool, MVC assigns Controller/ActionMethod/Id of object to <a href>*@

}


@* Don't use partial view, use actionlink, pass p, and that passes the value
  MVC will try to match property names and make a new object based off that*@


@*you can have one view from a given method/controller call a URL that gets/does 
something from/to an entirely different controller/method.  The power of URL routing.*@
